My name's Pete and *The Unforgiving Minute* is a space for me to write about running. I'm not a great runner and this site isn't here to pretend I am. I've often jotted race reports in my journal and thought it might be nice to record them online. It's a place to talk about running from the perspective of an everyday person who struggles to fit in enough training and is never quite as quick as they hope.

I'm a city dweller and run a lot on roads, but I come alive the most when I escape the asphalt and head for the hills; I'm convinced fell and trail running is one of the most joyful experiences around.

There's a line towards the end of the poem *If-* by Rudyard Kipling that says:

> If you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run, yours is the Earth and everything that's in it

For me that sums up nicely the runner's high and the euphoria that accompanies crossing the finish line of a race, whether you finished in first place *(I assume, having never done it!)* or last. The feeling that you wrung everything you had to give out of your body and beat the challenge infront of you is magical.

Hopefully you'll enjoy the blog but more than that, if you're not already a runner, maybe it'll inspire you to lace up and find a hill.

I'm based in Newcastle upon Tyne and I run for [Heaton Harriers](http://www.heatonharriers.org.uk/).
