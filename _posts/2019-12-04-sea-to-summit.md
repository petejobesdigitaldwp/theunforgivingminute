They were definitely naked. Sin ropa. Starkers. I couldn't say for certain whether they were doing yoga or tai-chi but it involved stretching. A surprising start to the morning, but apparently La Caleta is a hippy commune as well as a beach. I'd arrived at just the wrong moment.

I was staying in the village of Maro, lured by the towering Pico del Cielo rising 1,508 metres from sea to summit. 

From the apartment door, the summit is framed by a row of white washed Andalusian houses. I could’ve started there, but the poet in me wanted the waves lapping my feet. Plus, where better to calibrate an altimeter than at sea level? So I headed the kilometre down to the beach in the morning sun. 

I was very obviously out of place. I wasn't the only one in clothes, but I suspect I was the only one who didn't live there and the residents looked surprised to see me. I stood briefly in the waves and then set straight off up the steps.

From the beach there’s a hill up through the village leading to a bridge over the motorway to Cueva de Nerja. After only 1km, I was already a little breathless and desperate for a drink in the heat. I'd loaded a GPX file onto my watch to navigate and the route started here.

It was strange, given how much I love the hills at home, to find the initial climb is on the road. It’s mainly dirt, with a few concrete sections, but definitely a road. I gained about 800m of vert and 8km of distance before finally hitting the single track and the climb began in earnest. 

The going is mainly trail and the path is straight forward to follow, but knowing the summit was only 3km away and I still had 700m of climbing to do gave a daunting idea of the steepness to come.

With carry on luggage only, I'd taken my Salomon SpeedCross; I sometimes wear them for light hiking as well as running so they seemed a good shout for a trip away. They didn't disappoint — as the going got steep I encountered quite a few sheets of rock and it’s like having adhesive on your feet.

*The final approach and cross on the summit*

With only a couple of hundred metres elevation gain left, the trail became more scree and loose rocks — although still not technical. The sun glinting off the cross that marks the summit gave a clear point to aim for.

I seemed to cover the last stretch of climb in no time and within moments was on the summit. The views are amazing, down to Nerja and the Mediterranean to one side and across the tops of the clouds to the other.

Sea to summit took about two hours, which doesn't feel bad given the elevation and the fact it wasn’t a race.

The sensible thing to do, of course, would be to turn around and head back down. I'd achieved my objective, eaten my last haribo, used more than half of my water, and had no map other than the GPX file of my planned route. On the other hand, I could see more peaks.

Having enjoyed my moment of adrenaline and indulged in a summit selfie, I decided to crack on and see if I could make it a mini round of the three main peaks in the Sierras de Tejeda. Navachica was visible and it didn't look too tricky to get to so why not? 

What followed was half an hour of me picking my way over rocky ground, clambering over bushes and trying to guide myself by the ancient method of heading in the general direction of a visible summit.

*Enjoying the feeling of hitting the summit*

Having no map and the going being tough slowed me a lot. I came over a rise only to be confronted by a valley I'd have to cross to reach Navachica. It would mean at least one more huge climb to get across there and I was running low on water.

One of the biggest differences between the terrain here and back home is the total absence of water sources. I'd not seen a drop since leaving the village and, knowing I was into my second soft flask, decided discretion was the better part of valour and headed back.

By the time I hit Pico del Cielo for the second time, I'd spent about an hour covering only three or four km in my extra exploration. It offered great views but didn’t help with momentum.

I ducked off the summit but missed the path down - what had been an easy ascent became a bit tricky for the first part of the descent. Every rock I put my foot on moved and rolled, but there wasn't a good line for a fast scree descent. 

Things improved when the single track resumed and I started to pick up a little pace again. Every bush and plant in Spain seems designed to scratch and cut so my legs took a constant battering on the narrow path. I rolled my ankle with about 8km left but decided to push on through and let adrenaline mask the pain. That seemed to do the trick — it’s sore to walk on now but thankfully doesn’t seem sprained.

As soon as I hit the road again it became an easy downhill, towards Cueva de Nerja, and I set away on cruise control.

I arrived in the tourist car park at the caves and stopped the clock at 25km. The last part of the descent was boiling and I'd been unable to cool down so it felt great to finally stop. A bottle of Fanta Limon has never tasted so good.

Overall it was a great day on the hills. It's very different to the fells back home, both in the dry terrain and in the fact that up to the summit it was all road or trail. As I've only really done British mountains so far though, this automatically pops in at top spot on the elevation list. 

It’s one long 1,500m climb followed by one long descent. Less interesting than the scrambling on things like Helvellyn and Sgurr a' Mhaim, but the views are great and it was really good fun. Nice amount of vert and great to get that high up in December without a hint of snow or ice. 

I definitely need more hill miles in my legs though! Perfect excuse to come back to Andalusia again sometime soon. Nice to start with your feet in the waves and end with them in the clouds.
