I'll never forget the feeling of glancing at my watch on the way out of Carey Burn and realising I was almost bang on target. After over three and a half hours of racing in the sweltering sun I was within thirteen seconds of my pre-race goal.

It wasn't the first time I'd been on my race target, but it was the first time that it owed as much to a spreadsheet as training. It was the Chevy Chase last year and my first attempt at making data work for me in a race.

Runners are completely immersed in data. We track our runs with watches that record thousands of data points every activity. We become experts at reading weather data and Ordnance Survey maps. 

It's hard to know where to start tapping into it all but last year I decided to try some basic analysis to help me in the race.

Most fell races follow a simple format; you run to one or more checkpoints, in order, before the cut-off times. If you ignore the fact that two of the Chevy's checkpoints are the highest peaks in Northumberland, you could even consider it fun.

Given I'd done the race before, I had some data to start with. I set up a simple spreadsheet and entered:

* checkpoints
* distance between checkpoints
* cut-off times
* my splits from the year before
* my accumulated time
* the winner's splits 

With this data I could start to analyse my performance more. How did I handle different sections? Was I consistently slower than the winner, or was I proportionally slower on ascent or descent? Were any of my splits outliers? Where could I reasonably expect to go faster?

I set targets based on a combination of what I thought was possible and my target time. I'd ran the 2017 race in 4:37:12 and was keen to get below four hours in 2018. If your goal doesn't seem at least a little intimidating, it's time to set a harder one, right? 

I added in facts I knew from experience; I'd slow down at the end, the climb up Hedgehope would be awful, it's too narrow to overtake along the burn. I tailored my training slightly, knowing I had to get faster on the downhills.

With all this processed I copied the key points onto a phone wallpaper so that a glance at my lock screen would tell me what I needed to know. It showed checkpoints, cut-offs and distances alongside my last time, my target time and the pace I'd need to get there. 

Despite scorching sun, it went surprisingly well. For most of the race I hit checkpoints within less than two minutes of my target. I hit the final checkpoint just thirteen seconds slower than my overall target. It was on.

And then the inevitable happened; I turned right out of Carey Burn and saw the climb they call Hell's Path. I'd thought there was a simple, flat, 4.4k to the finish only to find another fierce hill. After running as near as I could my best race, I knew I couldn't push the required pace up another climb.

In the end I finished three minutes behind my targets, with a thirty four minute personal best. Given how close my times were at checkpoints, I'll take that as a win for rudimentary data analysis.

As we approach this year's race my spreadsheet has surfaced again. I've got both more data and more experience â€“ I know, for instance, that the only way out of the burn is via Hell's Path.

Because I now work in data and analytics I can't help but imagine what could be possible with the data. There are few sports that lend themselves as well as fell running to data-driven performance improvements. 

If you analysed every split from every runner you could find fascinating insights into the best pacing strategy. You could work out a runner's individual strengths and plan a pace and route to match them perfectly.

In the absence of all that, however, I'm happy with my spreadsheet. It may not seem like running but it sure seems to work.
