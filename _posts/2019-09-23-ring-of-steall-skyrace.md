Flower of Scotland. It's unlikely I'll ever hear it again without emotion welling up inside. It's Saturday and we're strung out along the northern slope of Stob Coire a' ChÃ irn. Only moments before I'd lost my footing on what should be an easy scramble around An Garbhanach. For a second I'm suspended between this life and the next, or at least it felt that way. I stare down at a 1500ft drop and my tired and cramping legs grapple to find their hold. 

A minute later and I'm back to normal but my nerves have frayed. That felt too close. It's then, starting to attack the summit climb, that the silent concentration of runners meets with the sound of the pipes. We push on, intensely focussed on the next step. Power hiking up, grabbing onto rocks to support or propel.

As I summit I thrust a fist into the air and yell my appreciation to the piper, stopping for a moment to applaud. That climb nearly killed me. Literally. But I sure did enjoy the music.

At this point I'm almost five hours in to the Ring of Steall Skyrace. It's the final race in the Salomon Golden Trail World Series and it's got a reputation as the most technical. The name alone causes a sharp intake of breath and that's before you stand at the start and look up at the Mamores towering above.

This was the big one for me. The one race I planned my season around. I pushed hard at the Chevy knowing I needed hills in my legs. My first fear on spraining my ankle was that I would miss this race. And every length in the pool when I couldn't run was with this moment in mind.

It did not disappoint. You start off with an unrelenting climb, gaining a thousand metres of elevation as you push up Sgurr an Iubhair. From there you're launched along the Devil's Ridge. I scan the skyline, drinking in the beauty of it all, fix my eyes on the next few metres of ground, and off we go. It looks pretty scary on video but during the race I was so focussed on those next footsteps I didn't notice the drop.

The ridge takes you to Sgurr a'Mhaim, the first Munro of the race. It's 1099 metres high and the views would be incredible if you stopped to look. Instead it's straight down the scree slope, half running and half surfing the dislodged stones.

With the scree negotiated and a couple of kilometres of more descent we hit Glen Nevis and the support station. After a pause to fuel there's five undulating kilometres through the forest to the river crossing at the Falls of Steall. An Gearanach looms ahead and it's an unrelentingly steep climb to the summit.

The scramble on An Garbhanach came next and that's when I had my moment of coming unstuck, before the emotional high of hitting the summit to the sound of the pipes.

There's only one more ascent after that, Am Bodach, another tough and rocky climb. As I summit I break into a broad smile and thrust my arms skyward. It's all down hill from here.

The top of the descent brought with it the brief and fleeting hope of a burst of speed but it soon became obvious my legs had gone. I make my way as quickly as possible over rocks and through bogs up to my shins. It's a testament to the S-Lab Speed shoes that they cope with everything the mountain throws at them.

With time ticking on I hit the road to Kinlochleven. I'd expected some kind of late surge but it's all I can do to limp onwards. A runner overtakes and tells me I can still do this. Sometimes that's all you need. I pick up into a jog and approach the bridge. Hearing the crowd cheer and the sound of cowbells I start to run again.

>A runner overtakes and tells me I can still do this. Sometimes that's all you need.

As I round the final corner the finish line clock turns 6:29:52. Not today. Hell, no. From somewhere deep inside I summon a sprint, spurred on by the crowd. I make it and moments later I'm bent double next to a barrier trying to breathe again.

All in all, I'm pleased with my performance, but there's unfinished business there for a future date. Skyline Scotland, I will be back.
