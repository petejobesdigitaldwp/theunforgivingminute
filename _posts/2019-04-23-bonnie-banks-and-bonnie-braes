If you want a hill with an influence on culture, you could do a lot worse than look at Ben Lomond. The most southerly of the Munros was immortalised in the song *Loch Lomond*.

> 'Twas there that we parted, in yon shady glen, On the steep, steep side o' Ben Lomond...

It's the most popular Munro, due to its location less than an hour north of Glasgow, and is climbed by around 30,000 people each year.
