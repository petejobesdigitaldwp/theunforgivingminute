I'd been driving west for about an hour and a half when it happened. As the A66 sweeps towards Keswick, Blencathra appears majestically to your right. It's like the gateway drug to the Lake District, luring you into the pleasures that await on the fells.

I was expecting a tough race today. You don't enter an 'A' category fell race if you're looking for an easy day. I'd read race reports, studied the OS map, looked at elevation profiles, and spent the best part of the week hitting refresh on mountain-forecast.com and the mountain weather information service. In spite of that, however, I still really wasnt prepared for quite how tough it would be.

The weather was sublime. It felt as though billions of years ago a benevolent creator had designed days like this as a kind of private joke, knowing that no one would truly appreciate them until people started to fell race. It was about 5&#176; celcius, the sky was clear, the sun was out and there was near enough zero wind. 

I set off reasonably close to the front of the pack to try and beat the bottle neck up the stairs at the bottom of Grisedale Pike. At the point I reached it we were fairly tightly packed in but it didn't feel like it slowed us down any more than stairs would anyway and we clambered up them like sardines. 

At the top of the stairs you're straight onto the long climb up Grisedale Pike. It's pretty unrelenting stuff and, aside from the briefest of runnable interludes, it was a hands on knees, heart pumping, power hike to the summit. The path had some scree but was mainly pretty straightforward. 

A quick drop of 180m in about 1.5km takes you to the foot of Eel Crags and that's where it gets tricky: in seemingly no time it becomes a hands and knees scramble up the scree and rocks. It was a pretty technical climb and once or twice my choice of line wasn't the best but the path flattens out for a runnable ascent across the snow to the summit of Crag Hill.

The descent from Crag Hill to Sail is also pretty technical and there were a few tricky moments before passing the marshalls at Sail and realising that the worst of the terrain was now behind us. There's a long sweeping trail down towards Barrow with a short and runnable climb to the summit.

The downhill to the finish was where I really entered the hurt locker. As I made to pick up pace my right heel started to throb with friction burn. A couple of guys I'd overtaken on the last climb sped past me as I limped the first part of what should've been a barnstorming finish. But glancing behind me and seeing the pack closing in I managed to put my foot down and block out the pain for a quick finish.

Overall the time wasn't as good as I'd hoped but it's a fantastic race on a great route. It's my first race back since injuring myself in January and I seem to have came out unscathed barring the friction burn. I love my Speedcross 4s but they were probably the wrong choice on the day and the synthetic socks really didn't help the situation. A major plus side on the gear front was my new S-Lab Sense Ultra 8 pack, which is practically weightless and gave great access to the soft flasks. There was no bounce and it hugs close to the skin.

A great day and will definitely come back for another crack at the Horseshoe.
