There was a moment, twenty five miles into the Edinburgh Marathon on Sunday, when I passed a group of spectators and one of them shouted, “come on Peter, you’re looking good”. 

It’s one of the most blatant lies I’ve ever heard. I was in bits, almost staggering along the road, but I sure was glad of the encouragement.

It all started so promisingly. There was rain and wind forecast for the whole race, which was a relief after the scorching heat of the last time I ran the marathon here. 

The start was densely packed and it was a slow first few hundred metres until we hit the top of the mound and the pace picked up. I spotted a couple of vests from other Geordie running clubs, something I always find it reassuring; I may be away from home, but home is always present.

I was ahead of pace through the first few kilometres but worked to control it, the mixture of enthusiasm and a down hill sweeps you along. 

I settled into a comfortable pace coming out of the city and started to count down the distance. About half an hour in the rain was replaced by bright sunshine. Not what you need on race day and I was soon longing for its return.

From Edinburgh you pass the finish line at Musselburgh, 9 miles in, and then there’s a long out and back along the shores of the Forth. The course hits half way just beyond Prestonpans and I had a roughly 1:43 split, still on track to get my target time of 3:30.

The turn around point is a short distance beyond the grounds of a country house and it loomed large on my mind. It’s where it all fell apart last time and I was starting to feel the weight of my legs again. I dug in and kept up the pace through the turn and the grounds, grinding out every metre. It was a real confidence boost to get out onto the road again just ahead of target. Almost twenty miles down.

The wind heading back towards the finish was intense. It didn’t seem to give any benefits when it was behind you and yet turned into a raging hoolie when you turned to face it. I kept the pace up through the twenty mile marker and started to believe it could be my day.

Twenty one, twenty two… at twenty two I noticed my pace had begun drop. My time was still where it should be for a 3:30 finish but the last mile was a fraction too slow – I needed to regain my pace if I was to get in target. I tried to push and got marginally quicker for a few moments before hitting the wall catastrophically at mile twenty three.

I walked a little to refuel but was struggling to get going again. The next two miles were a mixture of painful walking and then running. 

I was swaying dramatically as I passed the twenty five mile marker when a group of people noticed and started to cheer. They really started to go for it, shouting my name and the club name. And that’s when I heard the beautiful lie. 

“Come on Peter, you’re looking good.”

I managed to straighten up and pick up the pace again. I rounded the final corner and raised my right arm in the air, fist clenched, as I headed for the line.

I finished in 3:38:50 (though the split for the actual 42.2k was 3:37:09). I could barely walk and fumbled through the medal collection before dropping down next to a fence to recover.

It’s hands down the hardest I've ever pushed myself in a road race. My emotions are bittersweet. I ran a PB by over five minutes, and I'm pleased to have turned in my best performance yet, but for 23 miles, it was on. 

As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote; “It eluded us then, but that’s no matter – tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther … And then one fine morning– So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past.”

Tomorrow, we will run faster.
