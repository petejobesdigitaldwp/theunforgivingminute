There was a moment, twenty five miles into the Edinburgh Marathon on Sunday, when I passed a group of spectators and one of them shouted, “come on Peter, you’re looking good”. 

It’s one of the most blatant lies I’ve ever heard. I was a mess, almost staggering along the road, desperately trying to ring the last drop of energy from my body.

It all started so promisingly. There was rain and wind forecast for the whole race, a relief after the scorching heat of the last time I ran this one. 

We were densely packed for the first few hundred metres until we hit the top of the mound and the pace picked up. I had a chat with a lad from North Shields Poly on the way down the Royal Mile, enjoying some Geordie camaraderie before pushing on.

I was ahead of pace through the first few kilometres, the mixture of enthusiasm and a down hill sweeps you along but I worked to control it. 

With just half an hour gone, the rain was replaced by bright sunshine. The heat made running harder but my pace was now about right and I started to settle in for the long haul.

Coming out of Edinburgh you hit the coast and pass the finish line at Musselburgh, 9 miles in, before starting a long out and back along the shores of the Forth. The course hits half way just beyond Prestonpans and I clocked a roughly 1:43 split, still on track to get my target time of 3:30.

The turn around point is a short distance beyond the grounds of a country house and it loomed large on my mind. It’s where it all fell apart last time and I was starting to feel the weight of my legs again. I dug in and kept up the pace through the turn and on into the grounds, grinding out every metre. It was a real confidence boost to get out onto the road again just ahead of target. Almost twenty miles down.

The wind heading back towards the finish was intense. It didn’t seem to give any benefits when it was behind you and yet turned into a raging hoolie when you turned to face it. I was able to keep the pace up through the twenty mile marker and started to believe it could be my day.

Twenty one, twenty two… at twenty two I noticed my pace had begun to drop. The overall time was still where it should be for a 3:30 finish but the last mile had been a little too slow – I needed to regain my pace if I was to get in on target. I tried to push and got marginally quicker for a few moments before hitting the wall catastrophically at mile twenty three.

I walked a little to refuel but was struggling to get going again and the next two miles were a mixture of painful walking and then running. 

I was swaying pretty dramatically as I passed the twenty five mile marker when a group of people noticed and started to cheer. They really went for it, encouraging me by name and cheering for Heaton, and that’s when I heard the beautiful lie:

“Come on Peter, you’re looking good.”

I knew how bad shape I was in by this point but I'd take any encouragement I could get. I straightened up and picked up the pace again. Coming round the final corner I raised my right arm in the air, fist clenched, and headed for the line.

I finished in 3:38:50 (though the split for the actual 42.2k was 3:37:09). I could barely walk and fumbled through the medal collection before dropping down next to a fence to recover.

It’s hands down the hardest I've ever pushed myself in a road race. My emotions are bittersweet. I ran a PB by over five minutes, and I'm pleased to have turned in my best performance yet, but for 23 miles, it was on. 

As F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote; “It eluded us then, but that’s no matter – tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther … And then one fine morning– So we beat on, boats against the current, borne ceaselessly into the past.”

Tomorrow, we will run faster.
