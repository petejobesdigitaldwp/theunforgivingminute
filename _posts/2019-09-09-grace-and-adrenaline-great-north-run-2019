The Great North Run always feels special. There are so many things I don’t even like about the race; it’s over priced, the route is mainly on major roads, the gift bags at the end are weird, etc. But for a local lad? There can be few times you feel as in touch with home as running over the Tyne Bridge at the start of the Great North Run. 13.1 miles going from the place where I live to the place I was born.
