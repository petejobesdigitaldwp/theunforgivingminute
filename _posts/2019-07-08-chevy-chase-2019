If you ask the average person what they think of when they hear the words Chevy Chase, they'd probably name an eighties comedy actor. A few might name the town in Maryland. But if you're a fell runner it has only one meaning; it's twenty miles of glory and agony in the Northumberland fells.

Inspired by the medieval ballad of the same name, the Chevy is a romp over the biggest peaks in the Cheviot Hills. It's become a key weekend in my summer and one of the most important races in my year.
