The biggest question on my mind, after my first day of my new job last summer, had to be, 'what the heck do I know about data?' I'd started as an interaction designer at DWP and been assigned to work within data and analytics.

Surprisingly, during the first few weeks, I realised that running has taught me a lot about data. Many runners track our runs with watches that record thousands of data points every activity. Fell runners become experts at reading weather data, using both qualitative and quantitative data to check conditions. The biggest data and running cross over in my annual running calendar, however, has to be the Chevy Chase.

If you ask the average person what they think of when they hear the words Chevy Chase, they'd probably name an eighties comedy actor. A few might name the town in Maryland. But if you're a fell runner it has only one meaning; it's twenty miles of glory and agony in the Northumberland fells.

Inspired by the medieval ballad of the same name, the Chevy is a romp over the biggest peaks in the Cheviot Hills. It's become a key weekend in my summer and one of the most important races in my year. 

The race follows the familiar fell racing format; you run to eight checkpoints, in order and before the cut-off times. If you ignore the fact that two checkpoints are the summits of the highest peaks in Northumberland, you could even consider it fun.

This is perfect for data analysis. Last year I created a simple spreadsheet containing:

* checkpoints
* distance between checkpoints
* cut-off times
* my splits from the year before
* my accumulated time
* the winner's splits 

Using this data I could compare myself with the winner and see whether there was anything to note. Was I proportionally slower on ascent or descent? Were any of my splits outliers? Where could I reasonably expect to make savings?

I then started to set targets based on a combination of what I thought was possible and my target time. I'd ran the 2017 race in 4:37:12 and was keen to get below four hours in 2018. If your goal doesn't scare the hell out of you it's time to set a harder one, right? 

I added in facts I knew from experience; I'd slow down at the end, the climb up Hedgehope is awful, it's too narrow to overtake along the burn.

With all this processed I copied the key points onto a phone wallpaper so that a glance at my lock screen would tell me what I needed to know. It showed checkpoints, cut-offs and distances alongside my last time, my target time and the pace I'd need to get there. 

It felt a little stupid consulting my phone screen data sheet. This amount of preparation seemed too keen for an amateur but I really wanted that sub-four.

Despite scorching sun, it went surprisingly well. For most of the race I hit checkpoints within less than two minutes of my target. I passed Brand's Corner and headed for Carey Burn with no idea if I was running in the right direction anymore. I found the burn and hit the final checkpoint 13 seconds slower than my overall target. It was on.

And then the inevitable happened; I turned right out of the burn and saw the climb they call Hell's Path. I'd thought there was a simple, flat, 4.4k to the finish only to find another fierce hill. After running as near as I could my best race, I knew I couldn't push the required pace up another climb.

In the end I finished three minutes behind my targets, with a thirty four minute personal best. Given how close my times were at checkpoints, I'll take that as a win for data analysis in sports. 

As we approach this year's race my spreadsheet has surfaced again. I've got both more data and more experience â€“ I know, for instance, that the only way out of Hell path is via a steep hill.

But now I work in a data team I can't help but imagine what could be possible with the data. There are few sports that lend themselves as well as fell running to data-driven performance improvements. 

If you analysed every split from every runner you could find fascinating insights into the best pacing strategy. You could work out a runner's individual strengths and plan a race route to match them perfectly. 

In the absence of all that, however, I'm happy with my spreadsheet. It may not seem like running but it sure seems to work.
